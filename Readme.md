This project includes training and predicting processes with LSTM for stock data. The characteristics is as fellow: 

- Concise and modular
- Support three mainstream deep learning frameworks of pytorch, keras and tensorflow
- Parameters, models and frameworks can be highly customized and modified
- Supports incremental training
- Support predicting multiple indicators at the same time

- Support predicting any number of days in the future

PS: Tensorflow is the original code without the above characteristics.
